# EnDate App
Project developed for _Learn IT Girl_ mentorship program

## Project overview:

EnDate is an app for tracking expiration dates of products - make up, cosmetics, medicine.

People usually don't think about expiration dates when they start using new products. We throw the package right away and don't even bother to take notes about the date we bought or started using something. This could represent a big problem, since every product has a set date of expiration. If we continue to use expired products, we risk getting unwanted breakouts, redness, swelling, infections. This is especially dangerous for medicine.

EnDate allows users to keep track of the products they are using.
